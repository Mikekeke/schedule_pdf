# schedule_pdf
Simple app, that dynamically forms lists of items - currentky PDF files, that can be shown to user.
App forms categories and lists of items according to JSON-scheme.
E.g. this JSON-scheme: http://pastebin.com/raw/Kt2TwPrA (whole app was originally designed for my small hometown municipal busses schedule).
App just takes this scheme, construct categories and download PDF files.
As PDF reader app uses https://github.com/JoanZapata/android-pdfview (and 3d paty reader for API 10 and earlier)
